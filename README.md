Dataset had been imported from kaggle and necessary libraries had been imported.
Preprocessing techniques had been applied to the dataset.
OUTLIERS had been handled by different techniques.
DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS LIKE DECISION TREE, RANDOM FOREST, KNN, SVM, RIDGE AND LASSO REGRESSION HAD CHECKED.
ALSO WE CHECKED THE SCORE AND DID MODEL EVALUATION BY CHECKING THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR AND ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR. 
NOW, THE BEST MODEL IN M.L ALGORITHMS OF ALL IS THE ONE HAVING MINIMUM ERROR. HENCE, OUR FINALLY DECIDED ALGORITHM IS KNN
